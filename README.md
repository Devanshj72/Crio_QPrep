# Crio_QPrep

Learn and Practice algorithmic problems in a structured way.

- First articulating the problem statement clearly with examples.

- Brainstorming multiple approaches, understanding trade-offs and writing pseudocode for the chosen approach.

- Implementing the solution and testing it.

The deliberate divide-and-conquer practice helps the developer to approach unknown problems with reasonable confidence.

Please feel free to fork it and raise issues if you think that something could be done better. Happy coding!!
